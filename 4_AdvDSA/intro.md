Module 4: Advanced Data Structures
• Topics:
– Linked lists and trees for system resource management.
– Circular buffers for data streaming.
– Hash tables with collision resolution (chaining, open addressing).
– Tries for efficient string processing.
– Bit arrays for compact state tracking.
– Memory-efficient data structures for system utilities.
