Module 5: Concurrency in System Programming
• Topics:
– POSIX threads: thread creation (pthread_create), joining, and detachment.
– Synchronization primitives: mutexes, semaphores, condition variables.
– Priority inversion and priority inheritance mechanisms.
– Atomic operations using __atomic builtins for lock-free programming.
– Memory barriers for ensuring operation ordering.
– Spinlocks for low-latency synchronization in high-performance systems.
– Real-time scheduling: rate-monotonic scheduling (RMS), earliest deadline first (EDF).
– Deadlock detection and prevention strategies.
– Thread pools for efficient task management.
– Interrupt-driven concurrency for system events.
