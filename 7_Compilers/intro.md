Module 7: Compilers and Cross-Compilation
• Topics:
– Compiler pipeline: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, AST generation, code generation, optimization, and linking.
– Cross-compilation for platforms like ARM, RISC-V, and x86.
– Linker scripts for custom memory layouts (e.g., separating code and data sections).
– Code generation: instruction selection, register allocation, and peephole optimization.
– Optimization flags: -O2, -Os, -march for architecture-specific tuning.
– Inline assembly for low-level operations (e.g., CPU-specific instructions).
– Link-time optimization (LTO) for whole-program optimization.
– Toolchain customization: building GCC for specific targets.
– Debugging symbols and map file analysis for code size optimization.
– Compiler diagnostics and static analysis for error detection.
– Makefiles and more flags.
