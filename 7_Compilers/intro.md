Module 7: Compilers and Cross-Compilation

• Topics:

– Compiler pipeline: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, AST generation, code generation, optimisation, and linking.

– Cross-compilation for platforms like ARM, RISC-V, and x86.

– Linker scripts for custom memory layouts (e.g., separating code and data sections).

– Code generation: instruction selection, register allocation, and peephole optimisation.

– Optimisation flags: -O2, -Os, -march for architecture-specific tuning.

– Inline assembly for low-level operations (e.g., CPU-specific instructions).

– Link-time optimisation (LTO) for whole-program optimisation.

– Toolchain customisation: building GCC for specific targets.

– Debugging symbols and map file analysis for code size optimisation.

– Compiler diagnostics and static analysis for error detection.

– Makefiles and more flags.
