Module 3: Pointers and Function Pointers
• Topics:
– Pointer arithmetic for array and buffer manipulation.
– Function pointers for callback mechanisms and dynamic dispatch.
– Void pointers for generic programming.
– Pointer-to-pointer for multi-level data structures.
– const and volatile for safe memory access.
– Function pointer tables for system event handling.
