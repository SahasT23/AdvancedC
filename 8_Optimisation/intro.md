Module 8: Performance Optimisation

• Topics:

– Code profiling with gprof and hardware counters.

– Loop optimisation: unrolling, vectorisation, and loop fusion.

– Cache optimisation: data locality and alignment.

– Function inlining and dead code elimination.

– Compiler-assisted optimisations: -ffast-math, -funroll-loops.

– Power-aware programming for battery-powered systems.

– Trade-offs between code size, speed, and resource usage.
