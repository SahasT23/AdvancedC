Module 8: Performance Optimization
• Topics:
– Code profiling with gprof and hardware counters.
– Loop optimization: unrolling, vectorization, and loop fusion.
– Cache optimization: data locality and alignment.
– Function inlining and dead code elimination.
– Compiler-assisted optimizations: -ffast-math, -funroll-loops.
– Power-aware programming for battery-powered systems.
– Trade-offs between code size, speed, and resource usage.
