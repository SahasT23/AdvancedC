Module 9: Secure Coding

• Topics:

– Buffer overflow prevention using bounds checking.

– Input validation for robust system interfaces.

– Stack-smashing protection with canary values.

– Secure memory handling to avoid leaks and overwrites.

– Mitigating side-channel attacks (e.g., timing, cache attacks).

– Cryptographic primitives for secure data handling.
